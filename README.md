#Homelessness And Gender
Code Objectives:
  In the file Analysis_Gender.ipynb, the objective was to analyze how the homeless population has changed with respect to gender from the 2017-2020 time period. 
  The code graphs both state-by-state differences and differences in total gender distribution.
  The four gender categories studied are as follows: Male, Female, Transgender, Gender Non-Conforming
Conclusions:
  The population of male homeless individuals consistently exceeds that of other genders.
  The distribution of the homeless population in terms of gender has not changed significantly from the 2017-2020 time period.
  All genders saw an uptick in 2018
  The number of transgender individuals decreased slightly in 2020
  The rate of increase in gender non-conforming homeless individuals decreased from 2019 to 2020
Things to Consider:
  The information may be difficult to collect on transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals who are homeless because of discrimination and mis-identification
