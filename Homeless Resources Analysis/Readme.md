# Homeless Resources - Are We Doing Enough?
# Project 1

-While exploring and 'interviewing' our data I learned that we can find out how equipped the country is with resources for the homeless problem.

-I created 4 data sets one of beds count from 2017-2020, the second beds count for just 2020. The other 2 are the same thing but just the population count of the homeless instead of the beds count. 

-The first idea I had was to analyse how the resources are being allocated per State.  		

-Creating two bar charts one with the homeless population by state and another with the homeless see the change in the population over time compared the change in the count of beds in homeless shelters.

-Then I wanted see the change in the population over time compared the change in the count of beds in homeless shelters.

-So here I created one graph with two line plots one with the population and other the total count of beds for that year

-The most challenging part about this project was learning the different type of data types that can pass through to plots and the shapes of dataframes that it only accepts. Also learning how to tranpose data to it can fit into that shape as well.

# Data Conclusions
-First thing I noticed looking at the line plot comparing the homeless population change over time vs the count of beds in homeless shelters, was that the nation is inadequately equipped to meet the needs of the growing homeless population.

-From the muliple line plot we can see there has been a drastic turn upwards in 2018 in the population of homeless people yet that turn in numbers was not reflected in the count of beds which kept about the same amount throughout the 4 years.

-We can conclude the country is having a problem putting up enough resources to combat the growing count in the homeless population. Building more homeless shelters in the harder to access areas and the densest cities could help bring up the number of beds available in shelters. This in turn can bring down the population count as well, because more homeless people are able to rehab their lives in the shelters.
