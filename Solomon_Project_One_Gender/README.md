Gender Analysis:
- Objective:
  - To analyze the gender distribution both at the state-by-state and the country level from the 2017 to 2020 time period
  - To see the change in the homeless population in terms of gender from the 2017 to 2020 time period
- Conclusions
  - All gender categories saw an uptick in homeless population in 2018
  - The transgender homeless population saw a slight decrease in homeless populaiton in 2020
  - The male homeless population has consistently been greater than that of the other gender homeless populations
  - The overall distribution of the homeless population based on gender changed little from 2017 to 2020
- Next Steps
  - More data collection to ensure that misgendering has little influence on the data analysis
  - Comparison of total population by gender with its respective homeless population to see which group is more drastically affected.
